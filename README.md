# plog

A zero-config pretty-printer for structured logs (JSON, logfmt, glog/klog,
Python `logging`, logrus). Pipe a noisy log stream in, get a readable one out:

```sh
docker logs -f storefront | plog
```

This is a spike. It implements the four highest-leverage ideas from
[`IDEA.md`](./IDEA.md); the rest are phase-2.

## What it does

- **Semantic severity re-ranking** — an `INFO` line whose message says
  `panic` / `nil pointer` / `connection refused` is shown as `INFO→ERR` (or
  `→WARN`). Declared severity is never lowered.
- **Stack-trace collapse** — a stack trace serialized into a `msg`/`stack`
  field is parsed (Go and Node.js today, via a pluggable grammar registry);
  project frames (your module) are surfaced with `►` and `file:line`, while
  stdlib/third-party frames fold to `… N framework frames (pkgs…)`.
- **Consecutive-duplicate folding** — runs of near-identical lines (variable
  tokens masked: IPs, ports, hex, UUIDs, numbers) collapse to `… ×N`.
- **Adaptive columns** — fields that stay constant across the recent window
  (`service`, `rpc.component`, `rpc.service`) recede, dimmed and prefixed `·`,
  while the fields that distinguish a line (`rpc.method`, `error`,
  `rpc.status`, `rpc.duration`) lead it. Only fields with a single value seen
  repeatedly are demoted — new or varying fields always stay prominent.
- **Request correlation** — records that share a recent correlation key (an
  explicit `trace_id`/`request_id`-style field, or the client IP in the message)
  are tagged `⟨c…⟩` so one request reads as a group. And when a line follows a
  recent, more severe event for the same method within a few seconds, it is
  annotated `↳ likely related: …` — surfacing, e.g., the validation `finished
  call` tied to the panic just before it. The link is a heuristic hint, looks
  only backward (never reorders the stream), and is bounded in memory.
  `--no-correlate` disables it.
- **Multi-format parsing** — JSON, logfmt (`key=value`), glog/klog, Python
  `logging`, and logrus colored text are all decoded into the same record, so
  the whole pipeline lights up regardless of source format. The format is
  sniffed per line by default; `--format` pins it.
- **Robust passthrough** — unrecognized or malformed lines are emitted
  verbatim; a bad line never interrupts the stream.
- **Filtering** — `--min-level` (against the *re-ranked* level), `--grep` (a
  regexp over message and field values), and `--field key=val` (a repeatable
  substring match on any field you name) narrow the stream, combined with AND.
  `--field` makes no assumption about a stream's field names — `--field
  rpc.method=Resolve`, `--field logger=auth`, whatever your logs use. Non-JSON
  lines are never dropped by `--min-level`/`--field`; only `--grep` (on the raw
  line) can hide one.

Color is applied only when stdout is a terminal.

Same nine records, same information — but now: the panic's severity is
re-ranked `INFO→ERR`, its stack collapses to two project frames (`►
location_rpc.go:72`, `► logger.go:40`) with framework noise folded to `…
5 framework frames (…)`, the duplicate panic on the next connection folds to
`×2`, the validation failure that follows is linked back to the panic with
`↳ likely related: …`, and the repeated `connection refused` metrics error
folds to `×2` as well. The trailing non-JSON line still passes through
untouched.

## Usage

```sh
plog [flags]            # reads stdin, writes stdout

--module string         import-path prefix treated as project code
                        (default "github.com/example")
--format string         input format: auto (sniff), json, logfmt, glog,
                        python, logrus, or text (passthrough) (default "auto")
--no-fold               do not collapse consecutive near-identical lines
--no-columns            do not demote fields constant across the recent window
--no-correlate          do not group records by request or link related events
--min-level string      drop parsed records below this effective severity
                        (debug|info|warn|error)
--grep string           show only lines matching this regular expression
--field key=val         show only records whose named field contains a
                        substring, e.g. --field rpc.method=Resolve (repeatable)
--expand-stack          show every stack frame instead of folding
--no-color              disable ANSI color even on a terminal
--link string           make resolvable stack frames clickable via OSC 8
                        hyperlinks: an editor preset
                        (vscode|cursor|zed|idea|file) or a URI template with
                        {path}/{line}/{col} (TTY only)
--src string            local source root that --link resolves frame paths
                        against (default: current directory)
--version               print version information and exit
```

**Clickable frames** (`--link`): when tailing a service whose source is checked
out locally, `plog --link vscode --src ~/storefront` wraps each surfaced project
frame in an [OSC 8 hyperlink](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda)
your terminal opens on click. plog is a pipe, so it can't launch `$EDITOR`
itself — the terminal does. Frame paths are resolved by finding the longest
suffix that exists under `--src`, so a path from a remote/container tail (or a
minified bundle) that has no local file simply gets no link rather than a dead
one. TTY-only; ignored when output is piped or redirected.

Install:

```sh
go install github.com/shidil/plog/cmd/plog@latest
```

Try it against the bundled sample:

```sh
go run ./cmd/plog < testdata/sample.log
```

## Architecture

A streaming pipeline, one record at a time, with bounded memory:

```
stdin ─▶ parse ─▶ severity ─▶ stack ─▶ filter ─▶ correlate ─▶ columns ─▶ fold ─▶ render ─▶ stdout
        (line→    (re-rank)   (parse   (select   (group +      (demote    (collapse (lipgloss
         Record)               frames)  lines)    link)         constant)  repeats)  line/block)
```

Stage order is load-bearing: severity/stack run before `filter` so the filter
sees final levels/messages; `filter` runs before the stateful stages
(`correlate`, `columns`, `fold`) so their windows reflect only displayed lines;
`fold` is last because it is the only stage that delays output.

| Package            | Responsibility                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `internal/record`  | canonical `Record` type shared by every stage           |
| `internal/parse`   | line → `Record` (ordered JSON/logfmt walk, passthrough) |
| `internal/enrich`  | severity re-rank, stack parse, request correlation, adaptive columns, fold |
| `internal/filter`  | pure `Match` predicate (min-level, grep, field)         |
| `internal/render`  | `Renderer` interface + streaming `Plain` (lipgloss)     |
| `cmd/plog`         | flags, TTY detection, pipeline wiring                   |

`Renderer` is a small interface so a future interactive TUI (for the
`plog <file>` case) drops in without changing the pipeline.

### Known trade-off

Folding holds a run's head until the run ends, so folded lines lag on a live
tail. Because a follow (`docker logs -f`) never hits EOF, a 250ms timer applies
a wall-clock flush policy: a run that has paused (folded nothing for ~750ms) is
revealed promptly, while a run still actively folding is held — accumulating one
clean count — until a 3s cap. Use `--no-fold` for zero-latency raw streaming.
See the "Known trade-off" note in `CLAUDE.md` for the full policy
(`foldWindow`/`maxOpenRuns`/`idleFor`/`maxHold`).

## Develop

```sh
go test ./...                                              # unit tests
go test -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzParseLine -fuzztime=30s ./internal/parse
go test -bench=BenchmarkPipeline -benchmem ./cmd/plog      # pipeline throughput
```

New to the code? [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) is the orientation for the
architecture, package map, invariants, and where to make common changes.
